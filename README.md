This mod adds a complex, immersive, and fully automated way to craft Armor Trim Smithing Templates using Create machines and experience fluid.

Forget vanilla loot tables — now you **build your trims like an engineer**.

# 🔨 Making the Shards

The first step is to craft a **base shard** using various Create machines like the Press and the Basin. Each trim starts its journey as a raw material processed with care.

- In the first recipe, **Some Stones is pressed into a flat sheet**, forming the basis of the trim’s structure.
- Then, **some item like echo or moss is added** inside a basin and pressed, producing a charged and purified core shard.
- Each Trim got there personnal recipe check it with **JEI** mod.

# ⚙️ Assembling the Shard

With the base shards ready, the real process begins.

You’ll need to:

- Use **Mechanical Arms** to deploy Polished Diamond onto your shard (For fabric a simple Diamond is used).
- Run them through **Sequenced Assembly**, where each action upgrades the item step by step.
- Finally, **inject XP fluid** into the item using a **Spout** to awaken its full potential.

> Every trim has a different flavor — some require specific coral types, others need rare materials like diamonds or nether components.  
> The XP injection is what **activates the shard**, making it usable as a Smithing Template.

# Result

After these steps, you’ll have a **fully functional Armor Trim Template** — obtained through automation, logic, and style.  
Perfect for tech-based survival worlds or modpacks aiming to reduce RNG and promote **player-driven progression**.
